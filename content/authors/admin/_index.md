I am a development economist with over 10 years of experience working on fragile and conflict-affected settings. Currently, I hold the position of Research Fellow in the Global Risks and Resilience team at [**ODI Global**](https://odi.org/en/about/our-work/global-risks-and-resilience/). I am also an Associate Researcher at the [**Center for Studies and Research on International Development (CERDI)**](https://cerdi.uca.fr/), and a [**Civil War Path**](https://www.civilwarpaths.org/) Fellow.

I am a systemic risk analyst working on the messy space where conflict, climate risks, environmental change and fragile economies collide. My background is in development and conflict economics, applied micro-analysis and strategic/war studies.

I look at how governance fragmentation, exposure to weather extremes and shifting seasons, and armed-group dynamics play out across local, national and regional levels to shape what people can actually do to survive, adapt and stay in place—or are forced to move.

I also study what these places teach us about managing risk, scarcity and uncertainty — not just how they suffer from it. My work turns complex data and field realities into practical guidance for humanitarian, development and peacebuilding actors, helping make policy and programming better aligned with how risk really works on the ground.
