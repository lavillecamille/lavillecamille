I am a researcher specializing in conflict and defense economics. Currently, I hold the position of Research Fellow in the Global Risks and Resilience team at [**ODI**](https://odi.org/en/about/our-work/global-risks-and-resilience/). Additionally, I serve as an Associate Researcher at the [**Center for Studies and Research on International Development (CERDI)**](https://cerdi.uca.fr/). 

My research focuses on the local determinants of recurring conflict in developing countries and their impact on political decision-making related to security and development. I employ a holistic approach to conflict risk analysis, examining economic and political factors across multiple scales. I focus on understanding how local determinants, such as income changes and climate extremes, interact with broader conflict drivers, including real and perceived inequalities, politicization dynamics and the international arms trade. 

I am committed to advancing multidisciplinary and international research on peace and security, and I am always seeking opportunities to collaborate with researchers and practitioners who share this vision.
