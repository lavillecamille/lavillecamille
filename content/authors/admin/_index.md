Welcome to my academic page! I am a researcher in conflict and defense economics at the [**Chair of Defense Economics of IHEDN**](https://ecodef-ihedn.fr/). I am also an associate researcher at [**CERDI**](https://cerdi.uca.fr/). I hold a PhD in Economics from [**CERDI**](https://cerdi.uca.fr/) and was an associate PhD at [**IRSEM**](https://www.irsem.fr/).

I work on the local determinants of recurring conflict in developing countries, with a particular focus on West African countries. I study the impact of public decisions on the risk of political or intercommunal conflict, as well as the influence of local income and economic opportunities in the choice to join or support armed groups. I am also interested in the political economy of the trade in major conventional weapons, with a particular focus on economic offsets and spinoffs.

I am always looking for ways to support multidisciplinary and international research on peace and security. For example, I am part of the team of political scientists and economists involved in the ANR project [**PolisInWar**](https://cepel.edu.umontpellier.fr/recherche/polisinwar/). I am also the treasurer of [**AEGES**](http://www.aeges.fr/), which is an association that aims to promote the development and recognition of scientific studies on war, armed conflict, and defense issues.
